class OpenBlasSingleThread:
    """
    A context manager class to set OpenBLAS multi threading environment variable to 1 (i.e., single threaded). The
    class is used in a 'with'-statement to ensure that everything inside the statement is run single threaded,
    and outside the statement is run using whatever the environment variable was set before the 'with'-statement.
    The environment variable setting threading in OpenBLAS is OMP_NUM_THREADS.
