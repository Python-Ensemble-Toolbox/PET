# Python Ensemble Toolbox (PET)

The Python Ensemble Toolbox contains several packages that can be used
individually, or in combination. In the following we give a link to the
documentation for all the packages. The documentation is generated using pdoc
and will be updated alongside the code. Note that everything is not perfect.
Issues can be reported in the issue tracker.

## Misc

Please also peruse the main [README](https://github.com/Python-Ensemble-Toolbox/PET)
e.g. for *installation* instructions.
